/**
 * Clipboard provides an interface for getting and setting the contents of the
 * system clipboard.
 *
 * It is important to note that due to limitations on some operating systems,
 * setting the clipboard contents is only guaranteed to work if there is currently
 * an open window for which events are being handled.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ---
 * // get the clipboard content as a string
 * string str = Clipboard.getString();
 * // or use it in the event loop
 * Event event;
 * while(window.pollEvent(event))
 * {
 *     if(event.type == Event.Closed)
 *         window.close();
 *     if(event.type == Event.KeyPressed)
 *     {
 *         // Using Ctrl + V to paste a string into DSFML
 *         if(event.key.control && event.key.code == Keyboard.V)
 *             str = Clipboard.getString();
 *         // Using Ctrl + C to copy a string out of DSFML
 *         if(event.key.control && event.key.code == Keyboard.C)
 *             Clipboard.setString("Hello World!");
 *     }
 * }
